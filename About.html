        <p style="text-align: center; color: #444; font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px auto; max-width: 800px;">
            Luna Bags was born out of a passion for design and a deep appreciation for functionality. Founded in 2010, we started as a small workshop dedicated to crafting bags that meet the highest standards of quality and aesthetic appeal. Over the years, we have grown from a local business to a beloved brand that serves customers worldwide. Our journey has been fueled by a relentless pursuit of excellence, continuous innovation, and listening to the needs of our customers. From our first collection to the latest designs, we remain true to our roots of creating bags that tell a storyâ€”your story.
